#
# CudaBatchedSolver - an efficient solver and matrix inversion for small matrices,
#          using partial pivoting.
#

# Config file for CudaBatchedSolver.
#
# This file is used by CMake when find_package(CudaBatchedSolver) is invoked and either
# the directory containing this file either is present in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
# (if CudaBatchedSolver was installed), or exists in the local CMake package registry if
# the CudaBatchedSolver build directory was exported.
#
# This module defines a namespace CudaBatchedSolver:: and the target needed to compile and
# link against the library. The target automatically propagate the dependencies
# of the library.
#
# In your CMakeLists.txt  file just add the dependency
#
# find_package(CudaBatchedSolver CONFIG REQUIRED)
#
# Then if you want to link it to an executable
#
# add_executable(test yourfile.cpp)
#
# Then to the library
#
# target_link_libraries(test PUBLIC CudaBatchedSolver::CudaBatchedSolver)
#
# Note that target_include_directories() is not necessary.
